      "body": "Key derivation and blinding are sometimes used interchangeably, especially in the context of BIP32, but they seem to be different functionalities. In particular, key derivation works like so. Assume the key pair `x` and `xG`, for scalar `x` and generator `G`. Deriving a key with index `j` from `(x, xG)` can be done by computing a new private key `x_j = Hash(xG || j) + x` and the corresponding public key as `xG + x_jG`. This computation is deterministic and allows the public key to be derived based on _public_ information only, a property referred to in the literature as [public derivation](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/704.pdf). In contrast, one could generate `x_j` as `x_j = Hash(x || j) + x`. ",

Additive blinding may also be feasible, especially for other signature algorithms [like ECDSA](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1330.pdf). It generally works like so. Assume a private key `x` and public key `xG`, for generator `G`. Additive blinding generates secret key `x+b`, for random scalar `b`, and corresponding public key `xG + bG`. Note that these line up since `(x+b)G = xG + bG`.\r\n\r\nThis has some useful properties, like being able to blind and unblind using only the _public_ key. However, that may not be appropriate for all applications.",

      "body": "@tedeaton correctly observes that clamping the high-order bit in the EdDSA variants has the effect of making the resulting blind scalar distinguishable from a truly random scalar. Importantly, clamping that bit splits the set of blinded public keys in half -- one half where the bit is 0, which might be in the image set of the blind function, and the other half where the bit is 1, which definitely won't be in the image set of the blind function due to the clamp. This means that every blinded public key basically leaks one bit.\r\n\r\nThis leak could be exploited to recover the pre-image of the blind function. See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/chris-wood/a68c18aedf0914d13b8966f45f2d1ae7) for a toy example where we can recover the pre-image of blind given (a) sufficiently many random blind samples and (b) enough pre-computation work done by an attacker. The amount of work is substantial, i.e., on the order of O(group order), but we should probably acknowledge that this can be improved in practice with more sophisticated pre-computation or targeted attacks. \r\n\r\nIn any case, I think we ought to remove the clamping step for the blind scalar to ensure that it's a truly random scalar each time. For ed25519, this is as simple as changing the whole clamping step from:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbytes[0] &= 248 // clear cofactor\r\nbytes[31] &= 63\r\nbytes[31] |= 64\r\n```\r\n\r\nto \r\n\r\n```\r\nbytes[0] &= 248 // clear cofactor\r\n```",
